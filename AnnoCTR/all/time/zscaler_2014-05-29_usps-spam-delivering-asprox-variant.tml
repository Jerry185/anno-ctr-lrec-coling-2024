USPS Spam Delivering Asprox Variant   <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2014-05-29">May 29, 2014</TIMEX3>       UPDATE: The botnet which is described here is called 'Asprox'.  I've compared research with that seen from [StopMalvertising](https://www.stopmalvertising.com/malware-reports/analysis-of-asprox-and-its-new-encryption-scheme.html).  Recent email spam has begun taking advantage of user's need to snail mail something.  The attacker will forward a message supposedly from USPS in order to get victim's to click on a link purported to be a shipping receipt, which actually leads to a malicious file.  If the user is unfortunate enough to click the link in the spam mail, a zip file containing a variant of Asprox is downloaded.  |  |  | At the time of research, the VT score was [4/53](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/9f277c0e3660e6818359c7c6e84c3ea0dade7d79d84275bfd35d5157f4ab0416/analysis/) |  |  Once the file makes it way onto the desktop, it feigns a document icon in order to trick the user into thinking it is safe to view.  This is actually the malicious executable which scored [4/53](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/9f277c0e3660e6818359c7c6e84c3ea0dade7d79d84275bfd35d5157f4ab0416/analysis/) on initial VirusTotal scans.  |  |  | Never trust an icon.  Check the 'Right Click > Properties' to see the true extension |  The file itself creates local copies of itself in the logged-in User's Local Application Data and creates an autostarter to ensure that the victim stays infected after restarting their compromised PC.  |  |  | The threat installs a randomly generated Autostarter value |  ThreatLabZ has monitored this infection for a few days and observed several other download locations that kick off this threat.  |   | All links download a similar package.  |   |  |  |  The common factor across all of these dropped files is that they all POST bzip2 compressed data which is then encrypted with a 16-byte random RC4 key via HTTP as reported by [StopMalvertising](http://stopmalvertising.com/malware-reports/analysis-of-asprox-and-its-new-encryption-scheme.html).  We're seeing a growing number of attacks which utilize this method of phone home activity.  The case of this Asprox threat phones home over ports 443 and 8080.  |  |  | Communication is sent over port 8080 or 443 |  ThreatLabZ collected numerous IPs which were seen to communicate with malicious variants mentioned above.  |  |  | IPs which communicated with Malicious samples.  |  Users and Administrators should be cautious of all traffic regardless of the ports it communicates on.  Attackers are leveraging nonstandard HTTP ports in order to bypass some security solutions.
