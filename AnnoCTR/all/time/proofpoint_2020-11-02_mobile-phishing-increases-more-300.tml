Security Brief: Mobile Phishing Increases More Than 300% as <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2020">2020</TIMEX3> Chaos Continues  <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2020-11-02">November 02, 2020</TIMEX3>  COVID-19 rapidly shifted our society to rely on remote communication—and it’s clear cybercriminals are actively taking advantage of our new digital realities with an onslaught of mobile/text-message phishing (Smishing) attacks that claim to be from reputable companies.  We process more than 80% of North America’s mobile messages and our telemetry reports indicate mobile phishing messages increased by 328% in Q3 <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2020">2020</TIMEX3> when compared to Q2 <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2020">2020</TIMEX3>.  Overall, the top impersonated brands in Q3 <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2020">2020</TIMEX3> included prominent financial institutions, technology companies, and content providers (see below).  Thirty-six percent of the reported mobile messages also originated Communication Platform as a Service (CPaaS) providers, which points to the increased reliance on automated messaging programs.  This recent surge in mobile phishing reports is concerning given that our recent Proofpoint <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2020">2020</TIMEX3> State of the Phish Report found that 84% of organizations were subject to [mobile-based phishing attacks](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/glossary/smishing), and the FBI has reported that losses from phishing and other scams topped [more than $3.5 billion](https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2019-internet-crime-report-released-021120) to individual and business victims in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2019">2019</TIMEX3>.  The increased mobile phishing volume can be attributed to a number of factors.  For example, as consumers continue to be concerned about phishing, carriers and handset developers are working to make it easier to report mobile messaging abuse including phishing.  We’ve also seen mobile phishing reports extend beyond financial brands to include well-known brands across various market segments, especially brands that consumers are frequently turning to during the pandemic.  In addition, cybercriminals are continuing to invoke [social engineering techniques](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/corporate-blog/post/cybersecurity-101-what-social-engineering) and misuse known brands to expand credential harvesting capabilities in an attempt to circumvent mobile abuse detection systems.  ***Top Phished Brands and Examples***  ![Mobile Phishing_Blog_1](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Blog_Figure%201_Mobile%20Phishing.png)  *Fig 1:  Top Brands Featured in Mobile Messages, <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2020-09">September 2020</TIMEX3>*  ![Mobile Phishing_Blog_2](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Blog_Figure%202_Mobile%20Phishing.png)  *Fig 2:  <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2020-06">June</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2020-08">August 2020</TIMEX3> Mobile Phishing Report*  ![Mobile Phishing-Blog_3](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Blog_Figure%203_Mobile%20Phishing.png)  *Fig 3:  Example SMS phishing messages using known brands*   ***Anatomy of a smishing attack***  Netflix is a popular worldwide streaming service with tens of millions of customers in countries around the globe.  This level of exposure results in an opportunity for scammers to attempt to compromise user data to resell for profit.  Let’s examine how scammers use an easily recognized brand like Netflix in a smishing campaign to compromise user credentials.  The following timeline demonstrates a recent SMS phishing campaign:  * At **4:20pm** PDT a scammer starts a low-volume phishing campaign using a newly created website.  The following is an example of a received message:  *We've had an issue with your current billing details, Please update your information to avoid any service interruption.  netflix.usa-eng.org*  * By **4****:21pm** PDT **Proofpoint** Cloudmark analysis systems performed automated research on the domain contained in the phish and identified several suspicious characteristics.  The domain was immediately marked as suspicious.  * At **4:23pm** PDT Cloudmark starts blocking messages from the suspicious sender  * At **4:25pm** PDT a small group of messages are allowed due as some users dispute the spam classification  * By **4:26pm** PDT, all messages from this suspicious sender are being blocked  * From **4:26pm to****7:50pm**, Cloudmark systems detected thousands of additional phishing messages, all of which were blocked before arriving at the user device.  ![Mobile Phishing_Blog 4](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Blog_Figure%204_Mobile%20Phishing.png)  *Fig 4:  Timeline demonstrating automated SMS blocking of malicious messages*  Lookalike domains like the domain listed in the above timeline represent a common tactic of scammers.  These domain names often resemble the legitimate company domain name but instead take the user to a site controlled by the attacker.  These lookalike domains attempt to add legitimacy to fraudulent websites.  Whois research for the website listed notes the creation date as the same day the spam campaign occurred.  Being able to quickly purchase and setup up website capable of harvesting user input is a result of scripts and tools that attackers use to quickly automate the process.  This allows attackers to simulate brands with little time and effort and for maximum effect.  ![Mobile Phishing_Blog 5](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Blog_Figure%205_Mobile%20Phishing.png)  *Fig 5: Whois report for Netflix.usa-eng.org*  **Conclusion**  During these challenging times the value of messaging has never been more important, and the deliverability of legitimate messages is key to how we live and communicate.  Mobile messaging is attracting the attention of cybercriminals who see mobile messaging as an attractive vector to deliver their attacks into the hands of consumers and employees.  It is encouraging to see that mobile carriers and handset developers are taking strides to make it easier to report mobile abuse.  Having the ability to identify and block messages as rapidly as the campaigns evolve is paramount for the security for individuals and organization.
