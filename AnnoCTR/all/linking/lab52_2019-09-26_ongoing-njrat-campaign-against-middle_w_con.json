In a commercial context (i.e., an airline or air freight carrier), payload may refer only to revenue-generating cargo or paying passengers.  For a rocket, the payload can be a satellite, space probe, or spacecraft carrying humans, animals, or cargo. For a ballistic missile, the payload is one or more warheads and related systems; the total weight of these systems is referred to as the throw-weight.  The fraction of payload to the total liftoff weight of the air or spacecraft is known as the \"payload fraction\". When the weight of the payload and fuel are considered together, it is known as the \"useful load fraction\".
