An APT may have either business or political motives. APT processes require a high degree of covertness over a long period of time. The \"advanced\" process signifies sophisticated techniques using malware to exploit vulnerabilities in systems. The \"persistent\" process suggests that an external command and control system is continuously monitoring and extracting data from a specific target. The \"threat\" process indicates human involvement in orchestrating the attack.  APT usually refers to a group, such as a government, with both the capability and the intent to target, persistently and effectively, a specific entity. The term is commonly used to refer to cyber threats, in particular that of Internet-enabled espionage using a variety of intelligence gathering techniques to access sensitive information, but applies equally to other threats such as that of traditional espionage or attacks. Other recognized attack vectors include infected media, supply chain compromise, and human intelligence and deception. The purpose of these attacks is to place custom malicious code on one or multiple computers for specific tasks and to remain undetected for the longest possible period.

Other recognized attack vectors include infected media, supply chain compromise, and human intelligence and deception.

The history of the Middle East dates back to ancient times, with the (geopolitical) importance of the region being recognized for millennia. Several major religions have their origins in the Middle East, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam; the Baha'i faith, Mandaeism, Unitarian Druze, and numerous other belief systems were also established within the region.

The term's definition was traditionally associated with state sponsorship, but over the last few years there have been multiple examples of non-state sponsored groups conducting large-scale targeted intrusions for specific goals.  An APT may have either business or political motives. APT processes require a high degree of covertness over a long period of time. The \"advanced\" process signifies sophisticated techniques using malware to exploit vulnerabilities in systems. The \"persistent\" process suggests that an external command and control system is continuously monitoring and extracting data from a specific target. The \"threat\" process indicates human involvement in orchestrating the attack.  APT usually refers to a group, such as a government, with both the capability and the intent to target, persistently and effectively, a specific entity. The term is commonly used to refer to cyber threats, in particular that of Internet-enabled espionage using a variety of intelligence gathering techniques to access sensitive information, but applies equally to other threats such as that of traditional espionage or attacks. Other recognized attack vectors include infected media, supply chain compromise, and human intelligence and deception. The purpose of these attacks is to place custom malicious code on one or multiple computers for specific tasks and to remain undetected for the longest possible period. Knowing the attacker artifacts, such as file names, can help a professional make a network-wide search", "label_id": 3008833, "label_title": "Advanced persistent threat", "label_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25874360", "entity_class": "CE", "entity_type": "CON", "document": "quoteintelligence_2021-04-28_us-sanctions-against-russias-cyber"}
