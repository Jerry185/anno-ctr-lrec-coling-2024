The \"threat\" process indicates human involvement in orchestrating the attack.  APT usually refers to a group, such as a government, with both the capability and the intent to target, persistently and effectively, a specific entity. The term is commonly used to refer to cyber threats, in particular that of Internet-enabled espionage using a variety of intelligence gathering techniques to access sensitive information, but applies equally to other threats such as that of traditional espionage or attacks. Other recognized attack vectors include infected media, supply chain compromise, and human intelligence and deception. The purpose of these attacks is to place custom malicious code on one or multiple computers for specific tasks and to remain undetected for the longest possible period. Knowing the attacker artifacts, such as file names, can help a professional make a network-wide search", "label_id": 3008833, "label_title": "Advanced persistent threat", "label_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25874360", "entity_class": "CE", "entity_type": "CON", "document": "lab52_2022-01-12_tokyox-dll-side-loading-an"}
