Music-themed Malvertising Lead To Angler    January 19, 2016       ### Overview  Malvertising, or "malicious advertising," is not a new threat, and just a few weeks into 2016 ThreatLabZ has observed a malvertising campaign injecting iframes into banner advertisements that lead to Angler Exploit Kit.   Surprisingly, the Angler operators took some vacation for the New Year, as noted by [F-Secure](https://labsblog.f-secure.com/2016/01/19/angler-exploit-kits-january-vacation/), and have only recently resumed operations, so we were surprised to see a malvertising campaign so soon after their break.  This post will detail aspects of this campaign, and there is a reference list of indicators at the end of this post.  #### OpenX/OpenAds and Malvertising  OpenAds, now called OpenX or Revive Adserver, is an advertisement platform with a long history and is still quite popular.  From a high level, when a user browses to a website using OpenAds for serving advertisements, small code stubs make requests to the OpenAds server, which decides which banner advertisement to run and sends the banner ad plus some tracking code back to the page.  The banner advertisements usually rotate on some interval, and a single ad server can serve and control advertisements for multiple domains.  Unfortuantely, the nature of banner advertisements makes them highly lucrative for criminal groups since injecting malicious content into an advertisement can impact hundreds or thousands of sites.  This particular campaign impacted multiple OpenAds/OpenX servers which affected hundreds of domains.  Intermediary sites were used as an additional hop prior to serving the Angler landing page, and only six second-level intermediary domains were observed, each using dozens of different subdomains and URIs.   All six second-level intermediary domains share music-themed names:  * everyoneismusical.com  * musik4fingersonthemove.com  * musik4littlefingers.com  * youaremusical.com  * youaremusicalforms.com  * youaremusik.com  Interestingly, these intermediary domains only use two different IPs for all the subdomains, and the operators appear to have changed hosts suddenly.  Figure 1 shows the number of hits we captured for these two IPs.  |  |  | Fig 1: Hits on Intermediary Domain IPs |  ### iframe Trampolining  The infection cycle starts with a malicious iframe injected in the banner advertisement code that references an intermediary URL.   The injected iframe loads transparently, and the intermediary domain server will respond in one of the following three ways:  * Response code 200 - iframe to Angler Exploit Kit landing page  * Response code 204 - no content  * Response code 404 - fake 'not found' page  If the intermediary domain serves an iframe, the Angler landing page is loaded transparently.  A more complete overview of the infection cycle is shown below in Figure 2.  |  |  | Fig 2: Overview of Infection Cycle |  We're calling the intermediary domain an "*iframe trampoline*" since the server may not respond with another iframe and can simply bounce the user out of the infection cycle with benign content.  ### Infection Cycle  Looking at a full infection cycle in Figure 3, the benign domain 'giftsnideas.com' loads a banner ad with OpenX which contains an injected iframe to the trampoline domain.  The trampoline domain's iframe finally sends the user to the Angler landing page.  In this instance, the exploit failed, so no further content was loaded.  |  |  | Fig 3: Relevant URLs for Exploit Cycle |  Banner advertisement code on OpenAds/OpenX is very similar between servers.  Figure 4 shows the injected iframe, which is simply inserted into the legitimate banner advertisement code.  |  |  | Fig 4: Advertisement with Injected iframe |  All trampoline domains used a very similar URL format of two alphabetic directories followed by an alphabetic JavaScript file (.js).  The only content loaded in every successful instance is an iframe to the Angler landing page, as shown in Figure 5.  |  |  | Fig 5: Trampoline Header and Response |  The Angler landing page is exactly what you'd expect and although there have been some recent changes, we won't rehash Angler in this post.  |  |  | Fig 6: Angler Landing Page |  ### Conclusion  Malvertising continues to be a highly effective means of targeting and compromising a large number of victims, and we expect this trend to continue for 2016.  We noted that many of the victim sites we observed in this campaign were radio stations and auto enthusiast forums.  Domains in these two groups are owned by Saga Communications and Autoforums.com, so it's likely that each uses a small number of ad servers to power the entire network of sites.  ThreatLabZ will continue to monitor this campaign.  ### Indicators  | # Hits | Second Level Domain | Registrar | Registrant |  | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | 23883 | youaremusik.com | GODADDY | Mark Lippman |  | 20681 | musik4fingersonthemove.com | GODADDY | Mark Lippman |  | 16878 | everyoneismusical.com | GODADDY | Michael Lippman |  | 16849 | musik4littlefingers.com | GODADDY | Mark Lippman |  | 5698 | youaremusical.com | GODADDY | Michael Lippman |  | 1619 | youaremusicalforms.com | GODADDY | Michael Lippman |  #### URL IPs  188.227.72.137 - IT-Grad nets - AS48096    188.227.74.150 - IT-Grad nets - AS48096  #### List of FQDNs and URLs  Counts and FQDNs - via [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com/7vSYi2uz) (http://pastebin.com/7vSYi2uz)URLs - via [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com/QN9WqzPn) (http://pastebin.com/QN9WqzPn)   #### Whois Samples  Domain Name: MUSIK4LITTLEFINGERS.COM    Registry Domain ID: 1916653940\_DOMAIN\_COM-VRSN    Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.godaddy.com    Registrar URL: http://www.godaddy.com    Update Date: 2015-04-05T16:22:42Z    Creation Date: 2015-04-05T16:22:42Z    Registrar Registration Expiration Date: 2018-04-05T16:22:42Z    Registrant Name: Mark Lippman    Registrant Organization:    Registrant Street: 4 Cloverbrooke Court    Registrant City: Potomic    Registrant State/Province: Maryland    Registrant Postal Code: 20854    Registrant Country: US    Registrant Phone: +1.2404294083    Registrant Phone Ext:    Registrant Fax: +1.1    Registrant Fax Ext:    Registrant Email: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)    Registry Admin ID:    Admin Name: Mark Lippman    Admin Organization:    Admin Street: 4 Cloverbrooke Court    Admin City: Potomic    Admin State/Province: Maryland    Admin Postal Code: 20854    Admin Country: US    Admin Phone: +1.2404294083    Admin Phone Ext:    Admin Fax: +1.1    Admin Fax Ext:    Admin Email: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)    Registry Tech ID:    Tech Name: Mark Lippman    Tech Organization:    Tech Street: 4 Cloverbrooke Court    Tech City: Potomic    Tech State/Province: Maryland    Tech Postal Code: 20854    Tech Country: US    Tech Phone: +1.2404294083    Tech Phone Ext:    Tech Fax: +1.1    Tech Fax Ext:    Tech Email: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)    Name Server: NS67.DOMAINCONTROL.COM    Name Server: NS68.DOMAINCONTROL.COM   Domain Name: EVERYONEISMUSICAL.COMRegistry   Domain ID: 1917710979\_DOMAIN\_COM-VRSNRegistrar   WHOIS Server: whois.godaddy.com  Registrar URL: http://www.godaddy.com  Update Date: 2015-06-04T12:18:00Z  Creation Date: 2015-04-08T19:34:50Z  Registrar Registration Expiration Date: 2018-04-05T11:59:59Z  Registrar: GoDaddy.com, LLC  Registrar IANA ID: 146  Registrar Abuse Contact Email: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  Registrar Abuse Contact Phone: +1.4806242505  Domain Status: clientTransferProhibited http://www.icann.org/epp#clientTransferProhibited  Domain Status: clientUpdateProhibited http://www.icann.org/epp#clientUpdateProhibited  Domain Status: clientRenewProhibited http://www.icann.org/epp#clientRenewProhibited  Domain Status: clientDeleteProhibited http://www.icann.org/epp#clientDeleteProhibited  Registry Registrant ID:   Registrant Name: Michael Lippman  Registrant Organization:   Registrant Street: 4 Cloverbrooke Court  Registrant City: Potomic  Registrant State/Province: Maryland  Registrant Postal Code: 20854  Registrant Country: US  Registrant Phone: +1.2404298083  Registrant Phone Ext:  Registrant Fax:   Registrant Fax Ext:  Registrant Email: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  Registry Admin ID:   Admin Name: Michael Lippman  Admin Organization:   Admin Street: 4 Cloverbrooke Court  Admin City: Potomic  Admin State/Province: Maryland  Admin Postal Code: 20854  Admin Country: US  Admin Phone: +1.2404298083  Admin Phone Ext:  Admin Fax:   Admin Fax Ext:  Admin Email: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  Registry Tech ID:   Tech Name: Michael Lippman  Tech Organization:   Tech Street: 4 Cloverbrooke Court  Tech City: Potomic  Tech State/Province: Maryland  Tech Postal Code: 20854  Tech Country: US  Tech Phone: +1.2404298083  Tech Phone Ext:  Tech Fax:   Tech Fax Ext:  Tech Email: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  Name Server: NS37.DOMAINCONTROL.COM  Name Server: NS38.DOMAINCONTROL.COM
