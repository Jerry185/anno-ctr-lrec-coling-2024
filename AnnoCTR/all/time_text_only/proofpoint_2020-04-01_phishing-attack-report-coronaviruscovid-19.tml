Phishing Attack Report Coronavirus/COVID-19 Payment Lures on the Rise  April 01, 2020  Proofpoint researchers have observed an emerging trend of credential phishing and social engineering lures around COVID-19 financial relief.  These campaigns use the promise of payments by global governments and businesses (specifically financial institutions) aimed at easing the economic impact of the ongoing pandemic to urge users to click links or download files.  In this credential phishing update surrounding payment fraud news, we highlight a few of these campaign examples that are targeting those in the U.S., UK, Australia.  **Government-Themed Attacks**  **Credential Phish: Trump Administration Covid-19 Check for Most Americans**   **Key Points:** This medium-sized credential phish campaign primarily targeted U.S. healthcare and higher education organizations with a message claiming that the Trump administration is considering sending most American adults a check to help stimulate the economy.  The email asks recipients to verify their email account through a malicious link that directs them to a phishing page.  **![US Stimulus Payment Phishing Email Example](data:image;base64_removed,)**  Figure 1 US Payroll COVID-19 Relief Lure  **Government-Themed Attacks Summary:**  This medium-sized credential phishing campaign primarily targeted the United States and was largely sent to healthcare and higher education organizations.  Secondary targeting for this campaign includes the technology industry, including information security companies.  The messages are notable for its crude design, as the message has clear grammar and usage errors and uses a basic webpage clearly branded by a free website maker for its credential phishing.  The email notes that “the Trump administration is considering sending most American adults a check for $1,000 as part of the efforts to stimulate the economy and help workers whose jobs have been disrupted by business closures because of the pandemic”.  Recipients are directed to verify their information for the “new payroll directory” by clicking the malicious link in the email.  If the recipient clicks the link, they are taken to the phishing page which asks for their domain\username, email address and password as shown in Figure 2.  ![Covid Phishing Email Landing Page](data:image;base64_removed,)  Figure 2 US Payroll COVID-19 Relief Credential Phishing Page  **Credential Phish: Australian Government Coronavirus/COVID-19 Tax Relief**   **Key Points:** This campaign claims to be sent by a major Australian newspaper and uses subject lines such as "Government announces increased tax benefits in response to the Coronavirus.

To appear authentic, the message includes supposed contact information for the paper and notes that they are “…happy to advise that we have now moved back to” the address provided.  It’s notable that the address in the email does not match the newspaper being spoofed.  The email claims that the “Government has released its stimulus package in response to the Coronavirus outbreak” and encourages the recipient to open the malicious attachment for more details.  The attachment is an Adobe .PDF document with spoofed Microsoft OneDrive branding that informs users that “Your document is waiting for you” and encourages them to click the embedded link as shown in Figure 4.  ![OneDrive Phishing PDF Example](data:image;base64_removed,)  Figure 4 Australian COVID-19 Tax Benefit Malicious Attachment  After clicking the link, the recipient is taken to a page that asks for their Microsoft OneDrive credentials.  **Credential Phish: WHO-IMF “Relief Compensation” Steals Emails and Passwords**  **Key Points:** This small email campaign targets technology and IT organizations with a subject line of "COVID 19 : Relief Compensation.
