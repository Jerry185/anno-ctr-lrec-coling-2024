In spearphishing, a specific individual, company, or industry will be targeted by the adversary. More generally, adversaries can conduct non-targeted phishing, such as in mass malware spam campaigns. Adversaries may send victims emails containing malicious attachments or links, typically to execute malicious code on victim systems. Phishing may also be conducted via third-party services, like social media platforms. Phishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.", "label_id": 161, "label_title": "Phishing", "label_link": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566", "entity_class": "CI", "entity_type": "TECHNIQUE", "document": "intel471_2021-04-07_ettersilent-maldoc-builder-macro-trickbot"}
