Initial Access consists of techniques that use various entry vectors to gain their initial foothold within a network. Techniques used to gain a foothold include targeted spearphishing and exploiting weaknesses on public-facing web servers. Footholds gained through initial access may allow for continued access, like valid accounts and use of external remote services, or may be limited-use due to changing passwords.", "label_id": 584, "label_title": "Initial Access", "label_link": "https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001", "entity_class": "CE", "entity_type": "TACTIC", "document": "intel471_2021-09-30_public-sector-cybersecurity-threats-2021"}
