Ptrace system call injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.   Ptrace system call injection involves attaching to and modifying a running process. The ptrace system call enables a debugging process to observe and control another process (and each individual thread), including changing memory and register values.[1] Ptrace system call injection is commonly performed by writing arbitrary code into a running process (e.g., by using malloc) then invoking that memory with PTRACE_SETREGS to set the register containing the next instruction to execute. Ptrace system call injection can also be done with PTRACE_POKETEXT/PTRACE_POKEDATA, which copy data to a specific address in the target process's memory (e.g., the current address of the next instruction).[1][2]  Ptrace system call injection may not be possible when targeting processes with high-privileges, and on some systems those that are non-child processes.[3]  Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via ptrace system call injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.", "label_id": 1675, "label_title": "Process Injection: Ptrace System Calls", "label_link": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1631/001", "entity_class": "CI", "entity_type": "TECHNIQUE", "document": "quoteintelligence_2019-01-21_new-evidence-might-link-lazarus"}
