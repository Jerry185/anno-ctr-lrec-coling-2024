Abuse of hidden “well-known” directory in HTTPS sites
March 26, 2019
WordPress and Joomla are among the most popular Content Management Systems (CMSs).
They have also become popular for malicious actors, as cybercriminals target sites on these platforms for hacking and injecting malicious content.
During the past few weeks, ThreatLabZ researchers have detected several WordPress and Joomla sites that were serving Shade/Troldesh ransomware, backdoors, redirectors, and a variety of phishing pages.
The most well-known threats to CMS sites are the result of vulnerabilities introduced by plugins, themes, and extensions.
In this blog, we are focusing on the Shade/Troldesh ransomware and phishing pages that we detected last month from several hundred compromised CMS sites.
Shade ransomware has been quite active in the wild and we have been seeing a number of compromised WordPress and Joomla sites being used to spread the ransomware.
The compromised WordPress sites we have seen are using versions 4.8.9 to 5.1.1 and they use SSL certificates issued by Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME)-driven certificate authorities, such as Let’s Encrypt, GlobalSign, cPanel, and DigiCert, among others.
These compromised WordPress sites may have outdated CMS plugins/themes or server-side software which potentially could also be the reason for the compromise.

Fig 1: Hits of Shade and phishing in detected CMS sites
During the past month, our cloud blocked transactions for compromised WordPress and Joomla due to Shade ransomware payloads (13.6 percent) and phishing pages (27.6 percent), with the remaining blocks due to coinminers, adware, and malicious redirectors.
We have been monitoring the compromised HTTPS sites for a few weeks and have noticed that attackers are favoring a well-known hidden directory present on the HTTPS website for storing and distributing Shade ransomware and phishing pages.
The hidden /.well-known/ directory in a website is a URI prefix for well-known locations defined by IETF and commonly used to demonstrate ownership of a domain.
The administrators of HTTPS websites that use ACME to manage SSL certificates place a unique token inside the /.well-known/acme-challenge/ or /.well-known/pki-validation/ directories to show the certificate authority (CA) that they control the domain.
The CA will send them specific code for an HTML page that must be located in this particular directory.
The CA will then scan for this code to validate the domain.
The attackers use these locations to hide malware and phishing pages from the administrators.
The tactic is effective because this directory is already present on most HTTPS sites and is hidden, which increases the life of the malicious/phishing content on the compromised site.
The different types of threats that we found under the hidden directory in the past month are shown in the below image.

### **Case** **I: Shade/Troldesh ransomware under the****hidden** **directory**
The graph below shows the Shade/Troldesh ransomware under the hidden directory that we detected last month.

Fig 4: Shade/Troldesh ransomware hits over one month
In the case of Shade/Troldesh ransomware, every compromised site has three types of files: HTML, ZIP, and EXE (.jpg), as shown below.
![](/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/sites/default/files/images/wellknown3-1_1553159184.PNG)
Fig 5: Shade in hidden SSL validation directory
*inst.htm* and *thn.htm* are HTML files that redirect to download ZIP files.
*reso.zip*, *rolf.zip,* and *stroi**-invest.zip* are ZIP files that contain the JavaScript file.
*msg.jpg* and *msges.jpg* are EXE files that are the Shade ransomware.

Fig 6: Shade Infection chain
Troldesh is typically spread by malspam with a ZIP attachment or a link to an HTML redirector page, which downloads the ZIP file.
The malspam pretends to be an order update coming from a Russian organization.
An example of an email that has the link of the HTML redirector is shown below.

Fig 8: Redirector to download ZIP
The ZIP file contains only the JavaScript file with a Russian name.
The JavaScript is highly obfuscated and encrypted strings are decrypted at runtime by the below function.

Fig 9: Decryption function
After decryption, the JavaScript has the functionalities shown below.
It tries to connect one of the two URLs, downloads the payload in %TEMP%, and executes it.

Fig 10: Simplified JavaScript code
The downloaded payload is the new variant of Shade/Troldesh ransomware, which has been around since 2014.
It has two layers of packers: custom and UPX. After unpacking, it saves its configurations in “HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\System32\Configuration”.

xcnt = Count of encrypted files
xi = ID of infected machine
xpk = RSA public key for encryption
xVersion = Version of current Shade ransomware
The command-and-control (C&C) server is *a4ad4ip2xzclh6fd[.]onion*.
It drops a TOR client in %TEMP% to connect to its C&C server.
For each file, the file content and file name are encrypted with AES-256 in CBC mode with two different keys.
After encryption, it changes the filename to BASE64*(AES(file\_name)).ID\_of\_infected\_machine.crypted000007.*

It drops a copy of itself in *%ProgramData%\Windows\csrss.exe* and makes a run entry for this copy with the name “BurnAware.
It drops *README1.txt* to *README10.txt* on the desktop and changes the wallpaper as shown below.

*README.txt* has ransom note in both Russian and English languages.

The phishing pages we have seen up to this point, which are hosted under SSL-validated hidden directories, are related to Office 365, Microsoft, DHL, Dropbox, Bank of America, Yahoo, Gmail, and others.
