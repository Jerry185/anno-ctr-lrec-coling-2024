Wonder Woman, Piracy, and the Cerber Ransomware
June 26, 2017
It’s become a lucrative business for malicious actors to host illegal streaming websites and upload or link to bootlegged content.
The income from such activity is generated from the advertisements served to visitors.
At the same time, attackers have become more savvy, devising new methods for getting users to click on ad links, as we noted in a [previous blog](/blogs/research/march-madness-fake-streams-and-phishing-attempts).
In some cases, users are  tricked into clicking on ad links before being allowed to watch the streaming content.
Others require visitors to simply close the ads; while that may seem harmless, we have observed one example in which Exploit Kit actors are using this technique to their benefit.
**Analysis**
In this instance, we observed the streaming website *gomovies[.]to* serving visitors the Magnitude Exploit Kit (EK).
While many watchful users might have checked this site for malicious activity on a website scanner, there’s a good chance they wouldn’t have found any.
We checked the *gomovies[.]to* site on VirusTotal and, at the time of this writing, the streaming site had no detection.

The streaming website has a collection of bootlegged copies of recently released movies.
One such movie was *Wonder Woman,* and the site offered multiple links to audience-recorded (“cammed”) copies.
If visitors to the site are not chosen by the malvertising network to be infected, they get the usual streaming options, as shown below.

However, when visitors from East or Southeast Asia decide to visit the same link (http://gomovies[.]to/film/wonder-woman-20963/watching.html?ep=655097), they are redirected to a malvertising URL (http://xml.targead[.]com/click?i=xVLSH*HPpm4\_0), which serves a HTTP 302 redirect, shown below.

The redirected URL *gaperbizfunds[.]org/* now serves an obfuscated JavaScript in the HTML head section, as shown below.
We observed that the obfuscation style has changed a little from the previous week.

This redirect sends us to the second Magnitude EK gate, which presents another obfuscated JavaScript, shown below.

We see a check happening for a Kaspersky plugin, which if unsuccessful, will redirect the user to the landing page.
On the landing page, we find the scripting engine memory corruption vulnerability (CVE-2016-0189) being leveraged to exploit the target machine.

Before the actual exploit payload is served, a lightweight flash file is served to perform fingerprinting on the victim's machine.
The exploit kit author collects information such as operating system and the flash plugin version as seen below.

The *Capabilities* check output is returned to the attacker's server in the form of a GET request (hxxp://abbsd68ucd03p[.]datadry[.]men/WIN%209,0,277,0).
We then see an attempt by the *regsrv32.exe* to register an executable named *eK01G3.exe*.

The payload delivered by this cycle was Cerber ransomware as shown in the screenshot below.

In this case, the files were encrypted with the extension .8840.
Conclusion:
-----------
Users must be careful to avoid malicious streaming websites, relying only on official services.
Users must also ensure that their systems are updated with all the relevant patches, and special care must be taken to keep plugins and browsers updated.
Zscaler ThreatLabZ is actively monitoring Magnitude EK activity to ensure that Zscaler customers are protected.
