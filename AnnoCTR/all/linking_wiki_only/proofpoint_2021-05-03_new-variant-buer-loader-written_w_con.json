The company was primarily interested in offshore and intercontinental deliveries, but the success of FedEx prompted their own intra-US expansion starting in 1983.  In 1998, Deutsche Post began to acquire shares in DHL. It reached controlling interest in 2001, and acquired all outstanding shares by December 2002. The company then absorbed DHL into its Express division, while expanding the use of the DHL brand to other Deutsche Post divisions, business units, and subsidiaries. Today, DHL Express shares its DHL brand with business units such as DHL Global Forwarding and DHL Supply Chain. It gained a foothold in the United States when it acquired Airborne Express.  The DHL Express financial results are published in the Deutsche Post AG annual report. In 2016, this division's revenue increased by 2.7 per cent to €14 billion.

Rewriting the malware in Rust can enable the threat actor to evade existing Buer detections that are based on features of the malware written in C.", "label": "Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language. Rust emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. Rust enforces memory safety—that is, that all references point to valid memory—without requiring the use of a garbage collector or reference counting present in other memory-safe languages. To simultaneously enforce memory safety and prevent concurrent data races, Rust's borrow checker tracks the object lifetime and variable scope of all references in a program during compilation. Rust is popular for systems programming but also offers high-level features including functional programming constructs.Software developer Graydon Hoare designed Rust while working at Mozilla Research in 2006. Mozilla officially sponsored the project in 2009, and the designers refined the language while writing the Servo experimental browser engine and the Rust compiler. Rust's major influences include SML, OCaml, C++, Cyclone, Haskell, and Erlang. Since the first stable release in January 2014, Rust has been adopted by companies including Amazon, Discord, Dropbox, Facebook (Meta), Google (Alphabet), and Microsoft. Rust has been noted for its growth as a newer language and has been the subject of academic programming languages research.", "label_id": 5903538, "label_title": "Rust Foundation", "label_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66677404", "entity_class": "NE", "entity_type": "ORG", "document": "proofpoint_2021-05-03_new-variant-buer-loader-written"}
