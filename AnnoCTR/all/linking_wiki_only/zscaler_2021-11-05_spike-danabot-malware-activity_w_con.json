In a commercial context (i.e., an airline or air freight carrier), payload may refer only to revenue-generating cargo or paying passengers.  For a rocket, the payload can be a satellite, space probe, or spacecraft carrying humans, animals, or cargo. For a ballistic missile, the payload is one or more warheads and related systems; the total weight of these systems is referred to as the throw-weight.  The fraction of payload to the total liftoff weight of the air or spacecraft is known as the \"payload fraction\". When the weight of the payload and fuel are considered together, it is known as the \"useful load fraction\". In spacecraft, \"mass fraction\" is normally used, which is the ratio of payload to everything else, including the rocket structure.", "label_id": 21301, "label_title": "Payload", "label_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41495", "entity_class": "CE", "entity_type": "CON", "document": "zscaler_2021-11-05_spike-danabot-malware-activity"}

A supply chain attack can occur in any industry, from the financial sector, oil industry or government sector. Cybercriminals typically tamper with the manufacturing process of a product by installing a rootkit or hardware-based spying components. In an Internet Security Threat Report, powered by Symantec, it is stated that supply chain attacks still continues to be a feature of the threat landscape, with an increase by 78 percent in 2018.  The recent Target security breach, Eastern European ATM malware, as well as the Stuxnet computer worm are examples of supply chain attacks.  Supply chain management experts recommend strict control of an institution's supply network in order to prevent potential damage from cybercriminals.", "label_id": 2416926, "label_title": "Supply chain attack", "label_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19755176", "entity_class": "CE", "entity_type": "CON", "document": "zscaler_2021-11-05_spike-danabot-malware-activity"}

Malware does the damage after it is implanted or introduced in some way into a target's computer and can take the form of executable code, scripts, active content, and other software. The code is described as computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, and scareware, among other terms. Malware has a malicious intent, acting against the interest of the computer user—and so does not include software that causes unintentional harm due to some deficiency, which is typically described as a software bug.  Programs officially supplied by companies can be considered malware if they secretly act against the interests of the computer user. For example, at one point Sony music Compact discs silently installed a rootkit on purchasers' computers with the intention of preventing illicit copying; but which also reported on users' listening habits, and unintentionally created extra security vulnerabilities.  One strategy for protecting against malware is to prevent the harmful software from gaining access to the target computer. For this reason, antivirus software, firewalls and other strategies are used to help protect against the introduction of malware, in addition to checking for the presence of malware and malicious activity and recovering from attacks.", "label_id": 10247, "label_title": "Malware", "label_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20901", "entity_class": "CE", "entity_type": "CON", "document": "zscaler_2021-11-05_spike-danabot-malware-activity"}
