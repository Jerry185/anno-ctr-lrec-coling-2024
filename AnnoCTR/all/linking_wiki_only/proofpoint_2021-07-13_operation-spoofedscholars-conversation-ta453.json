Other recognized attack vectors include infected media, supply chain compromise, and human intelligence and deception.

Whereas the Iranian Army defends Iranian borders and maintains internal order, according to the Iranian constitution, the Revolutionary Guard (\"pasdaran\") is intended to protect the country's Islamic republic political system. The Revolutionary Guards state that their role in protecting the Islamic system is preventing foreign interference as well as coups by the military or \"deviant movements\".  The Revolutionary Guards have roughly 125,000 military personnel including ground, aerospace and naval forces. Its naval forces are now the primary forces tasked with operational control of the Persian Gulf. It also controls the paramilitary Basij militia which has about 90,000 active personnel. Its media arm is Sepah News.  Since its origin as an ideologically driven militia, the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution has taken a greater role in nearly every aspect of Iranian society. Its expanded social, political, military and economic role under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's administration—especially during the 2009 presidential election and post-election suppression of protest—has led many Western analysts to argue that its political power has surpassed even that of the country's Shia clerical system.  The Chief Commander of the Guardians since 2019 is Hossein Salami who was preceded by Mohammad Ali Jafari and Yahya Rahim Safavi respectively from 2007 and 1997.  The IRGC is designated as a terrorist organization by the governments of Bahrain,", "label_id": 393629, "label_title": "Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps", "label_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1285472", "entity_class": "NE", "entity_type": "ORG", "document": "proofpoint_2021-07-13_operation-spoofedscholars-conversation-ta453"}

Malware does the damage after it is implanted or introduced in some way into a target's computer and can take the form of executable code, scripts, active content, and other software. The code is described as computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, and scareware, among other terms. Malware has a malicious intent, acting against the interest of the computer user—and so does not include software that causes unintentional harm due to some deficiency, which is typically described as a software bug.  Programs officially supplied by companies can be considered malware if they secretly act against the interests of the computer user. For example, at one point Sony music Compact discs silently installed a rootkit on purchasers' computers with the intention of preventing illicit copying; but which also reported on users' listening habits, and unintentionally created extra security vulnerabilities.  One strategy for protecting against malware is to prevent the harmful software from gaining access to the target computer. For this reason, antivirus software, firewalls and other strategies are used to help protect against the introduction of malware, in addition to checking for the presence of malware and malicious activity and recovering from attacks.", "label_id": 10247, "label_title": "Malware", "label_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20901", "entity_class": "CE", "entity_type": "CON", "document": "proofpoint_2021-07-13_operation-spoofedscholars-conversation-ta453"}
